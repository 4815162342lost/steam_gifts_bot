Hey hey hey,

We still alive! We do not die!
Version 1.4.0 is available now!

Please, remove settings.txt, user_agent.txt and cookie.txt files. They are not needed anymore!!!
Use and edit settings.cfg instead. This is important!!!

Also, please, recreate bad_giveaways_link.txt, black_list_games_name.txt, search.txt files. Syntaxis has been changed.
This is also important!!!

Now you need python 3.6 or higher to run the script. Because we are using f-straings. Do not update the script if you do not able to use python 3.6!

What new:
-- major code improvement! Now code looks better!
-- move configs (user-agent, confs, cookies) to one singe settings.cfg file
-- cnage syntaxis of the bad_giveaways_link.txt, black_list_games_name.txt, search.txt files
-- fix bug "Fix - script crashes if there is no pinned giveaways" (https://github.com/4815162342lost/steam_gifts_bot/pull/8)
